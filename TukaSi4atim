You are tasked to help planning the next Programing Fundamentals course by keeping track of the lessons, that are going to be included in the course, as well all the exercises for the lessons. 
On the first input line you will receive the initial schedule of lessons and exercises that are going to be part of the next course, separated by comma and space ", ".

Exercise:{lessonTitle} – add Exercise in the schedule right after the lesson index, if the lesson exists and there is no exercise already, in the following format "{lessonTitle}-Exercise". If the lesson doesn`t exist, Add the lesson in the end of the course schedule, followed by the Exercise.
